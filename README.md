# Wolt assigment
## How to get this to work
1. You need Java same as or above version 8
    - in cmd do 'java --version', if it shows you version from java 8 (inclusive), you are good to go
    - if you have no java, install Oracle JDK or OpenJDK 8+ version

2. Install sbt: https://www.scala-sbt.org
3. Run sbt with command "sbt", once sbt shell is up - run project with "run" command
    - if sbt shell tells you that ports for webserver are in use - use "run %any port number", eg "run 9010"
4. To run tests use "test" command in the sbt shell context
